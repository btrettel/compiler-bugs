# compiler-bugs

A collection of bug reports I made for various Fortran compilers.

The [HPC Bug Reproducers](https://github.com/HPC-Bugs/reproducers) repository has some good advice on what to include in a bug report:

> When creating a report/reproducer, at minimum a README.md file should be included in the folder. The README should contain the following information:
> 
> - The version(s) of the tool and the environment(s) in which it malfunctions
> - Point to additional content in the folder necessary to reproduce the issue
> - Detailed description of the steps needed to reproduce the issue
> - (optional) A description for how to work around the issue
> 
> Any other source code, input files, etc. should also be included in the created folder sufficient for an independent contributor to reproduce the encountered issue.
