# Bug 0005

- date reported: 2024-05-06
- compiler: ifx 2024.1.0
- bug report URL: <https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-Fortran-Compiler/Increasing-the-size-of-the-interface-contains-stack/m-p/1595451#M172075>
- status: bug confirmed
- action to complete when fixed: Use larger units modules.

## Bug report message

I've attached a zip file containing a reproducer. Included are 3 different versions of the module of varying sizes:

- pdim_12.f90: 12 types, 170 functions (compiles both the module and program)
- pdim_30.f90: 30 types, 837 functions (fails to compile the program, but compiles the module)
- pdim_50.f90: 50 types, 2205 functions (fails to compile the program, but compiles the module; included in case pdim_30.f90 compiles fine on you all's end as this probably won't compile)

Here's a command line log showing what I see:

For comparison, gfortran compiles all of these fine, and fast too.

To be clear, all of these modules are generated by another Fortran program. As far as I'm aware, the generated modules are valid Fortran, though the generated modules are unusually large. So I am not surprised to run into issues compiling and maybe even run into some hard-coded compiler limits. I'm not sure there is a bug in ifx, but please take a look and let me know. If my code is doing anything wrong, let me know too. If it might help, I can explain what I'm trying to do here as well.

(Also: Trying `-no-ipo` did not help here.)
