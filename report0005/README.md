## Bug report message

### ifx 2024.1.0 `-check uninit` false positive when reading namelist with multiple lines

I recently upgraded to ifx 2024.1.0 and was excited to try the new MemorySanitizer. Unfortunately, there appears to be a false positive uninitialized value when reading namelist files if a namelist is spread across multiple lines. My guess is that ifx is checking whether each line has an uninitialized variable, when it should check at the end of the namelist.

To make the reproducer simpler, I tried putting the namelist in a `character` variable, but the bug doesn't appear in that case for me. The bug may require an external file. I have a file which passes and a file which fails. You can see in the output where the failure occurs.

Reproducer:

passes.nml:

    &bug x=1 /

fails.nml:

    &bug
    x=1
    /

bug0005.f90:

    program bug0005

    implicit none

    integer :: nml_unit, x

    namelist /bug/ x

    open(newunit=nml_unit, file="passes.nml", status="old", action="read")
    read(unit=nml_unit, nml=bug)
    close(unit=nml_unit)

    print *, x

    open(newunit=nml_unit, file="fails.nml", status="old", action="read")
    read(unit=nml_unit, nml=bug)
    close(unit=nml_unit)

    print *, x

    end program bug0005

Since there are multiple files, I've attached them to this post (with the .nml files renamed to .txt as they couldn't be uploaded as .nml, and the code adjusted accordingly).

Command line log (I forgot the debug flag, so add that to get the precise line with the issue):

Thanks.

A thought I had later: My reproducer wasn't made quite as I had intended, and seems to have exposed a different bug than what I thought I was showing. My intention was to show that if x is undefined before a namelist read, uninit checking worked only if the namelist is on one line. I did show that to myself, but that's not quite what my posted reproducer showed. In my reproducer, x was already defined by the second namelist read, where the error was. So the error is wrong for a second reason: x was already defined by that point.
